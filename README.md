Predicting-Churn-Customers

Overview: 
The Predicting Churn Customers project aims to address the challenge of customer churn in the credit card industry. By analyzing extensive customer data, this project seeks to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning, allowing businesses to proactively take measures to retain them.

Key Steps:

1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Analyzed extensive credit card customer data using advanced data analytics techniques. Employed preprocessing methods to handle missing 
   values, outliers, and imbalanced data, ensuring the data's quality for subsequent analysis.

2. Model Development: Developed a customer churn prediction model by implementing various machine learning algorithms, including K-Means Clustering, Decision Tree, Gradient 
   Boosting,Bagging,Random Forest, XG Boost.Conducted a comparative analysis of these models to identify the most accurate one for predicting customer churn.

3. Integration of Customer Interaction Insights: Analyzed customer interaction data, including account activity, product usage, and feedback. Prioritized building positive 
   customer relationships based on the insights gained, aiming for improved customer retention.
